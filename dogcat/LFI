- we can use filters to read the content of index .php so we know how the files are getting included

- we find that it checks if an ext paramter is passed otherwise it appends .php ( I tried to use %00 to eliminate it but it didn't work. It actually read it in the php but not the command) 

- We use the php://filter/convert.base64-encode/ressources=index.php

- We than read the access.log file

- Now we can inject php code into the access.log then read it to have an RCE

- reverse shell -> env privesc 

- .dockerenv in root

- find / -f ASCII -exec cat {}; | grep container

- find /opt/backups, it actually executes outside the container 

- we modify it to get another reverse shell 

- bingo !
