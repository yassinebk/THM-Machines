we got two files gpg and .asc. The gpg uses the GPUG methodology to encrypt and ensure the safety of the comm service.

The asc file when opened in the terminal it prints out some weird stuff and clears the terminal but when opened with vs code we can see some creds there and some encryption.

Some googling ( tried hashcat + gpg got nothing and john + gpg got some gpg2john thing) 
So I did transform the .asc to a gpg compatible file and executed john to find the password.

Now we should be using the gpg command to read the content of the .gpg file.
